//general structure:
////Searcher class that handles searching for listings
////Parser class that parses listings (input is URL and HTML output from API)
////Analyzer class that handles parsed listings 
////Broker class that handles buying and selling
////
////each class in its own javascript file, with a Main.js file that instantiates all of them and puts them to work
////each class with its own input queue that other classes can push to
////
////Big Picture:
////build a NodeJS or Go backend with full database and API that the scripts talk to
////scale it via Amazon AWS. Use EC2 instances to separate responsibilities of searching/analyzing and purchasing. Elastic IPs and randomized behavior for protection
